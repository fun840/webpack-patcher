# Webpack Patcher

This is a small userscript I made for patching Webpack. It's mostly intended to be used as a base for other scripts. This userscript was coded with Webpack 4 (`webpackJsonp`) in mind, but it should still work for Webpack 5.

Thanks to [Vendicated](https://github.com/Vendicated/) for some help with Webpack internals.
